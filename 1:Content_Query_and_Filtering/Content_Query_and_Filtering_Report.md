# Content Query and Filtering

<!-- What the Task was, intro, etc.  -->

## Setting up Wagtail
<!--  Pulling down and Setup; Setting the Query Fields (e.g. Search Field, and Filter Field) -->

## What we Tested and Restults
<!--  What Queries we tried (the 4 test cases, and results) -->

## Issues
<!--  Test case 4 is not working, and multiple AND filters seems to be a pain, seems like multiple ands are not supported out of the BOX  -->

## Suggestions
<!-- Maybe use graphql, Q langauge, etc. return everything and Serverside Filter in React,  -->
